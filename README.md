# bamazonCustomer

 Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront

 HOW TO MAKE IT WORK

First you want to open up your console and navigate to the bamazonCustomer app

Then you want to type in "node bamazonCustomer" (without the quotes)

From there a table will pop up with all the items we have in stock

You will then get prompted to shose one based on the id

Then it will promt you again asking how many you would like

If there is enough it will give you the total of the amount you asked for

Then it will update the table so there won't be the same amount next time

If there is not enough it will not let you purchase any of the products
